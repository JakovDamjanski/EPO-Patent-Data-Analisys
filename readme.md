# EPO Patent data Data Mining and feature engineering project

This project was made on the Technology Inteligence Platform  provided by EPO. The platform can be acessed by registering [here](https://www.epo.org/en/searching-for-patents/data/technology-intelligence-platform). The Data folder is incomplete because of github's single file size limits and the full version will be posted only in its final iteration on a link somewhere in the readme.

All of the data which is in the data folder is either from the Industry Mapping Study (sources are in the DataAnalisys notebook) or results from the Scraping notebook. To recreate the results and data found on the link you can just run the data creation notebook (and the DataAnalisys notebook.
